Changes from 2.3.1 made November 2019  JO'N

DLL loading now from the PSD1 file instead of the PSM1 file.
Now use presence AssembliesPath to judge "IsMacOS" -or "IsLinux"

Send-SeKeys
  Element and keys parameters are both mandatory
  Selenium keys now cached in a script-scoped variable for performance. (Get-SEKeys can be dopped)

Valdate-URL
   Function Renamed to validateUrl (private helper function does not need to use verb-noun naming and "validate" verb upsets script analyzer)
   added old name backs as an alias (which _is_ allowed. )

Get-SeCookie & Invoke-SeScreenshot
  In line with other functions, Driver is renamed Target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
  and throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var

New-SeScreenShot alias SeScreenshot . Merges Invoke-ScreenShot and SaveSeScreenShot
   Can pass -path,
            -passthru (Alias PT)
            -path & -passthru
       or   -AsBase64
   "Target" used instead of "driver", with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
   and throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var


Start-Fe-Firefox & Start-SeChrome
  Made startUrl the first parameter and added aliases "Chrome" and "Firefox"
  User can now write in a sort or DSL CHROME $URL etc.
  Now use parameter sets to avoid the conflict between Minimized/maximized/fullScreen,
  and use parameter validation to ensure StartURL is valid
  Added parameter aliases so "Incognito" works with Firefox and "PrivateBrowsing" works with Chrome
  Trap failure to return driver, raise a warning and simplified the subsequent ifs
  Added Parameter AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Removed a possible bug with piped input by not returning the driver in the process block instead of the end block
  Now calls .navigate method directly instead of via enter-SeURL

Start-SeEdge
  Added Alias "MSEdge", and parameters StartUrl, Maximized, Minimized parameters
  & AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit wait to 10 seconds

Start-SeInternetExplorer
  Added Alias "InternetExplorer" and parameters StartUrl  parameter & AsDefaultDriver which sets
  $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit wait to 10 seconds

new function Send-SeClick (with alias SeClick) {replacement for Invoke-SeClick}
  Element can be passed by position (first)
  JavaScriptClick can be abreviated JS
  Driver is ignored  (element.wrapedDriver used instead)
  Added SleepSeconds parameter
