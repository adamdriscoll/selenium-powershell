Changes from 2.3.1 made November 2019  JO'N

DLL loading is now from the PSD1 file instead of the PSM1 file.
Now use presence of $AssembliesPath to judge "IsMacOS" -or "IsLinux"

Send-SeKeys
  -Element and -Keys parameters are both mandatory
  Selenium-keys are now cached in a script-scoped variable for performance. (Get-SEKeys can be dropped)

Valdate-URL
   Function Renamed to validateUrl (private helper function does not need to use verb-noun naming and "validate" verb upsets script analyzer)
   Added the old name back as an alias (which _is_ allowed. )

Get-SeCookie & Invoke-SeScreenshot
  In line with other functions, -Driver prarameter is renamed -Target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
  and throws an error if no driver is passed or found from Global var

Start-Fe-Firefox & Start-SeChrome
  Added aliases "Chrome" and "Firefox" - user can now write in a sort of DSL "CHROME $URL -asDefault" etc.
  Made -StartUrl the first parameter and use parameter-validation to check it.
  Now call the .Navigate method directly instead of via Enter-SeURL if -StartURL is specified
  Now use parameter-sets to avoid the conflict between Minimized/Maximized/FullScreen,
  Added parameter aliases so "Incognito" works with Firefox and "PrivateBrowsing" works with Chrome
  Now trap a failure to return driver, and simplified the subsequent if statements
  Added Parameter -AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Removed a possible bug with piped input, by returning the driver in the process block instead of the end block

Start-SeInternetExplorer
  Added Alias "InternetExplorer" and parameter -StartUrl 
  Plus AsDefaultDriver which sets   $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit wait to 10 seconds

Start-SeEdge
  Added Alias "MSEdge", and parameters -StartUrl, -Maximized, -Minimized
  Plus -AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Set Implicit Wait to 10 seconds

Start-SeNewEdge  **New function** with alias, credge to support Chromium based edge. 
  Also added V79 webdriver. V80 and V81 don't work. 

Send-SeClick **New function** (with alias SeClick) {replacement for Invoke-SeClick}
  Element can be passed by position (first)
  -JavaScriptClick can be abreviated -JS
  Driver is ignored  (element.wrapedDriver used instead)
  Added -SleepSeconds parameter

New-SeScreenShot: **new function** with alias SeScreenshot. Merges functionality of Invoke-ScreenShot and SaveSeScreenShot
   Can pass -Path,
            -Passthru (Alias PT)
            -Path & -Passthru
       or   -AsBase64
   "Target" with alias "Driver", can come from $Global:SeDriver
   and throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var

Open-SeURL *new function** SeNavigate
  Url is first on the commandline and mandatory
  Driver is renamed target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
  Throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var
  Made interoperable with Enter-SEURL via aliases
  Commented out Enter-SeURL and changed PSD1,

Get-SeElement **New Function** alias seElement 
    New -By parameter with possible values "CssSelector", "Name", "Id", "ClassName", "LinkText", "PartialLinkText", "TagName", "XPath"
    combined with a "Selection" parameter which holds the value, replaces the 8 parameters with those names and parametersets.
    Wait made optional; -Wait without -Timeout sets timeout to 30 , and -Timeout 5 works without -Wait
    -Element and -Driver are merged as -Target which has aliases of 'Element' and 'Driver'
    Made interoperable with Find-seElement by aliases
    Commented out Find-seElement and updated PSD1.
