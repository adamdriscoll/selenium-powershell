# Installation
`Note: Firefox's Latest Gecko Driver on Windows requires Microsoft Visual Studio Redistributables for the binary to run get them `[Here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)


```powershell
Install-Module Selenium
```

OR

```
Import-Module "{FullPath}\selenium-powershell\Selenium.psd1"
```
## Possible Additional Steps
The following is based on the report of some users who tried to install this module and faced some issues.
You may have to donwload the appropriate `chromedriver.exe` from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and place it under the folder of selenium-powershell module `...\PowerShell\Modules\Selenium\3.0.1\assemblies`. To get the local folder, use this command:
```
(Get-InstalledModule -Name selenium).installedlocation
```
You can replace the existing `chromedriver.exe` or rename it to keep a safe backup.
 
When you install this module and you don't specify a version, the latest one will be installed. If it doesn't work, try using this command to install other version:
```
Install-Module -Name Selenium -RequiredVersion 3.0.1
```
To remove the old version, use powershell command `Get-InstalledModule -Name selenium | Uninstall-Module`, and also delete the local folder of Selenium, otherwise you may face other errors.
