# [Unreleased]

## Added

DLL loading is now from the PSD1 file instead of the PSM1 file.
Now use presence of $AssembliesPath to judge "IsMacOS" -or "IsLinux"

Send-SeKeys
  -Element and -Keys parameters are both mandatory
  Selenium-keys are now cached in a script-scoped variable for performance. (Get-SEKeys can be dropped)
  Added -PassThru


Valdate-URL
   Function Renamed to validateUrl (private helper function does not need to use verb-noun naming and "validate" verb upsets script analyzer)
   Added the old name back as an alias (which _is_ allowed. )
   Moved functionality into a validation class which so URLs are validated before enering functions

Checks for valid webdriver also moved to a validation class.

Get-SeCookie & Invoke-SeScreenshot
  In line with other functions, -Driver parameter is renamed -Target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
  and throws an error if no driver is passed or found from Global var

Start-SeFirefox & Start-SeChrome
  Added aliases "SeChrome" and "SeFirefox" - user can now write in a sort of DSL "SeCHROME $URL -asDefault" etc.
  Made -StartUrl the first parameter and use a parameter-validation class to check it.
  Now call the .Navigate method directly instead of via Enter-SeURL if -StartURL is specified
  Now use parameter-sets to avoid the conflict between Minimized/Maximized/FullScreen/Headless,
  Added parameter aliases so "Incognito" works with Firefox and "PrivateBrowsing" works with Chrome
  Now trap a failure to return driver, and simplified the subsequent if statements
  Set ImplicitWait to 10 seconds
  Added Parameter -AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver
  Added Parameter -Quiet to run tests without web driver prattle.
  Allow AzureDevops environment vars (GeckoWebDriver / ChromeWebDriver)  or commandline
  parameter -WebDriverDirectory to specify source of Webdriver.
  Removed a possible bug with piped input, by returning the driver in the process block instead of the end block

Start-SeInternetExplorer
  Added Aliases "SeInternetExplorer" & "SeIE" and parameter -StartUrl
  Plus -AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver, and -Quiet to run tests
  without web driver prattle.
  Allow AzureDevops environment vars or commandline parameter -WebDriverDirectory to specify source of Webdriver
  Set ImplicitWait to 10 seconds

Start-SeEdge
  Added Aliases "MSEdge" & "LegacyEdge", and parameters -StartUrl, -Maximized, -Minimized, FullScreen
  and -PrivateBrowsing (alias Incognito)
  Plus -AsDefaultDriver which sets $Global:SeDriver, instead of returning the driver, and -Quiet to run tests
  without web driver prattle.
  Added message if driver load errors - Webdriver is now added as a windows Feature and will be found from windows\system32,
  which is on the path. Removed old driver and SHA file.
  Set ImplicitWait to 10 seconds

Stop-SeDriver
  Updated to handle the default drive being in $global:SeDriver.

Start-SeNewEdge  **New Function** with alias, credge to support Chromium based edge.
  Also added V79 webdriver. Specifying V80. V81 from an ENV variable (EdgeWebDriver), or via command line requires
  it to be in the same directory as MSEdge.exe and -inPrivate, -headless, and -binaryLocation options don't work.

Start-SeRemote **New Function**
  Connects to remote driver by URL and requested capablites tested with testingbot.com

SeOpen **New Function**
  Takes -In (name of browser) and opens that browser and optional naviagates to destination in -URL
  The browser is opened as with -AsDefault and other options passed in -Options.
  If the browser name is omitted the function will look for $env:DefaultBrowser.
  Mainly for Pester/DSL freindliness - by changing the environment variable a different browser can be used in different test runs

Send-SeClick **New Function** (with alias SeClick) {replacement for Invoke-SeClick}
  Element can be passed by position (first)
  -JavaScriptClick can be abreviated -JS
  Driver is ignored  (element.wrapedDriver used instead)
  Added -SleepSeconds and -PassThru parameters

New-SeScreenShot: **New Function** with alias SeScreenshot. Merges functionality of Invoke-ScreenShot and SaveSeScreenShot
   Can pass -Path,
            -Passthru (Alias PT)
            -Path & -Passthru
       or   -AsBase64
   "Target" with alias "Driver", can come from $Global:SeDriver
   and throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var

Open-SeURL *New Function** with alias SeNavigate
  Url is first on the commandline and mandatory
  Driver is renamed target, with alias "Driver", and will come from $Global:SeDriver
  Throws an error if no driver passed or found from Global var
  Made interoperable with Enter-SEURL via aliases
  Back, forward and refresh are available via switches
  Commented out Enter-SeURL and changed PSD1,

Get-SeElement **New Function** with alias seElement
    New -By parameter with possible values "CssSelector", "Name", "Id", "ClassName", "LinkText", "PartialLinkText", "TagName", "XPath"
    combined with a "Selection" parameter which holds the value, replaces the 8 parameters with those names and parametersets.
    Wait made optional; -Wait without -Timeout sets timeout to 30 , and -Timeout 5 works without -Wait
    -Element and -Driver are merged as -Target which has aliases of 'Element' and 'Driver'
    Made interoperable with Find-seElement by aliases
    Commented out Find-seElement and updated PSD1.

Switch-SeFrame **New Function** with alias SeFrame

  Pester to throw if element was not found.

Get-SeSelectionOption **New Function** alias SeSelection
  For setting and checking options in a dropdown lists.

SeShouldHave **New Function**
